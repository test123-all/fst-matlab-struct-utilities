# FST matlab struct utilities
## Introduction:
This is the repository of the FST matlab struct utilities, a matlab package that consists of some helper functions to be able to work easier and more effective with larger and highly nested matlab structs. <br>

<br>
<b>DISCLAIMER</b>:<br>
This software is in a early proof of concept phase and mentioned in the ... paper. If you want to pay credit to this software in its current raw proof of concept state please cite the paper.<br>
<br>
Since this software is in a early proof of concept phase it is not commented out sufficiently yet, the functional segregation isn't good and in conclusion the function and variable names might be subject to siginificant change in the future. Therefore the backwards compatbility of the API won't be granted for now. <br>
<br>
As of the current plans the refactoring work will be done somewhere between the beginning of september 2024 and the end of december 2024 since the responsible person is a research aide and currently in exam phase. Thank you very much in advance for your understanding. <br>
